# Arbitrary-Image-Stylization
Arbitrary Image Stylization aloows the combination of any content image with any style image. The model we use here is from Tensorflow Hub, arbitrary-image-stylization-v1-256/2, is based on a Feed-Forward Convolutinal Neural Network(CNN) that can perform stylization in real-time.

## Key Components of Neural Style Transfer
**1. Content Image:** This is the image whose structure or whose content is preserve in the stylized output.
**2. Style Image:** TThis is the image that defined the artistic styles(colors, texture) that are to be applied to the content image.
**3. Output Image(Stylized Image):** This is the result of blending the content image with the style of the second image.
